This repository contains the code for my personal portfolio website hosted at [paymanshus.github.io](https://paymanshus.github.io).

## Current Features

- "Coming Soon" section for the blog
- Properly organized CSS in external file

## Planned Features
- Project showcase section
- Blog implementation (exploring Next.js or Notion integration)
- Dark/light mode toggle
- Contact form
- Interactive elements to showcase ML projects

## Development
This site is currently built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Future plans include exploring Next.js for enhanced functionality, particularly for the blog section.

### Blog Options
Two main options are being considered for the blog:
1. **Self-hosted with Next.js** - Complete control, better integration, learning opportunity
2. **Notion integration** - Easier content management, quicker setup

See the `blog-options.md` file for a detailed comparison.

## Next.js Starter
A Next.js starter template is available in the `next-portfolio-starter` directory for future development.
